    "Let's say that you are a spatial data analyst of a gold mining company, and want to know the distribution of gold percentage over 100m x 100m mining area. To understand the characteritics of the rock formations, you take 100 random rock samples from the mining area, but obviously these 100 data points are not enough to estimate gold percentage over every single spatial locations in the area. So you analyze the available data (100 rock samples from random locations) and simulate full 2D-surface plot for gold percentage over the mining area.\n",

    "> **Variogram** is a measure of dissimilarity over a distance. It shows how two data points are correlated from a spatial perspective, and provides useful insights when trying to estimate the value of an unknown location using collected sample data from other locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tobler's first law of geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography) states that \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\" Variogram demonstates just that. It shows how correlation between two spatial data varies over distances. For example, terrains 1 km apart from each other are more likely to be similar than terrains 100 km apart from each other. Oil wells 500 ft apart from each other are more likely to show similar reservoir characteristics than oil wells 5000 ft apart from each other. \n"
