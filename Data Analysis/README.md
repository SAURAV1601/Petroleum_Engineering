# General Information

  - I started this statistical analysis project around mid-October of 2018
  - More posts will be added as I learn more, and whenever I have free time
  - During the semester I am caught up with my schoolwork + part time internship. But I really love data science and I plan to continue making more posts throughout the semester. 
  - The contents in this project will change a lot as I improve & fix errors in my posts
  - I will be able to make many more posts during the winter break. 

I started this project to display my work to potential recruiters, and to retain & be able to apply the skills I learned in the class. Often times the trainings I had and knowledge I learned in the class are not sufficient enough to apply for real-world problems. I forget what I've learned the next semester, and the things I learn in class is not fully in-depth to know which technique to apply to which challenge, etc.... So I decided to have some extra trainings to prepare myself for real-world problems, and be able to retain the things I learned in class, by actually DOING stuff. 

Most of all, I like the subject. I didn't find engineering particularly interesting, but I think I absolutely love statistics. There are so many things I can do with it. It's just that I don't know what kind of techniques are available out there, and the methodologies for implementing them. I want to explore more. 


### Notes:
---

Github does not do very well in rendering Jupyter notebook files. Instead of viewing files directly on Github, use [NB Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aegis4048/) to view my work in a cleaner format.
