    "Based on historical data, expertise in the field, or past experience, you can draw an estimate of a population. While this estimate is useful for developing a model, it contains some inherent uncertainty and risk, because it's an estimate of an unknown value. In a financial market, you might know the distribution of possible values through the mean and standard deviation of returns. By using a range of possible values, instead of a single guess, you can create a more realistic picture of what might happen in the future. "
